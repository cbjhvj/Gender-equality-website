            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Gender equality, also known as sexual equality or equality of the sexes, is the state of equal ease of access to resources and opportunities regardless of gender, including economic participation and decision-making...</p>
        </section>
        <section id="statistics">
            <h2>Statistics</h2>
            <p>Here are some statistics about gender equality...</p>
            <p>1. The Global Gender Gap Index is a known indicator of gender equality worldwide. It benchmarks national gender gaps on economic, political, educational, and health-based criteria based on 14 indicators. According to the 2024 index, Iceland has the smallest overall gender gap,
               <br.followed by other Nordic countries like Finland, Norway, as well as New Zealand. On the other hand, gender parity in Afghanistan is deemed the most challenged.</p>
            <p>2. The Gender Inequality Index measures inequality in achievement between women and men in three dimensions: reproductive health, empowerment, and the labor market.
               <br>In 2021, Denmark topped the ranking,while Yemen was considered the least gender-equal country in the world.</p>
            <p>3. Europe has made the most progress towards gender parity, having closed more than 76% of the gender gap. However,
               <br>it is estimated that gender parity will not be achieved in Europe for another 67 years.</p>
            <p>4. Women continue to lag behind men in terms of economic opportunities and political empowerment.
               <br>For instance, less than one fourth of parliamentarians around the world are women</p>
            <p>5. Conflicts and crisis have a negative impact on gender equality. For example, as a result of the Taliban taking control of Afghanistan in 2021,
               <br>gender equality was the lowest in the whole world in Afghanistan as of 2023.</p>
            <p>6. The COVID-19 pandemic has also impacted gender equality negatively. Its economic effects were more heavily felt by women than men as the gender poverty gap increased in 2020 and 2021.</p>
